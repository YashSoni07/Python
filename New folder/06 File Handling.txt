File Handling
=============
open() function takes two parameters 'filename' and 'mode'

Modes
=====
'r'	Open a file for reading. (default)
'w'  	Open a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists.
'x'	Open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails.
'a'	Open for appending at the end of the file without truncating it. Creates a new file if it does not exist.
't'	Open in text mode. (default)
'b'	Open in binary mode.
'+'  	Open a file for updating (reading and writing)
'x'	Open for exclusive creation
a+	:append and read
r+	:read and write
w+    	:write and write


read() method
=============
read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return:

Eg:
f = open('hello.txt', 'r')
s = f.read() # f.read(2)
print(s)
f.close()

readline() method
=================
You can return one line by using the readline() method:

Eg:
file = open('six.txt', mode='r')
f = file.readline()
print(f)

By calling readline() two times, you can read the two first lines:

Eg:
file = open('six.txt', mode='r')
f = file.readline()
print(f)
f = file.readline()
print(f)


readlines() Method
==================
Return all lines in the file, as a list where each line is an item in the list object

Eg:
file = open('six.txt', mode='r')
f = file.readlines()
print(f)

['NameOne\n', 'NameTwo\n', 'NameThree\n', 'NameFour\n', 'NameFive\n', 'NameSix']

tell() method
=============
This method returns the current position of the file read/write pointer within the file. 
It`s position starts from zero

Eg:
f = open("hello.txt", 'r')
print(f.tell())  # 0
print(f.read())  # Hello, Hi How are you
print(f.tell())  # 21


seek() method
=============
This seek() method is used to change the position of the cursor
The cursor is always started from beginning.

Eg:
f = open("hello.txt", 'r')
print(f.tell())  # 0
print(f.read(2))  # He
f.seek(0)  # seek will change the position
print(f.read())  # Hello, Hi How are you


write() method
==============
write() method is used to write the string data
writelines() method writes all strings in list/tuple/set
