Dunder() Method
===============
1.Magic methods in Python are the special methods that start and end with the double underscores. 
  They are also called dunder methods.
2.Magic methods are not meant to be invoked directly by you, but the invocation happens internally from the class
3.For example, when you add two numbers using the + operator, internally, the __add__() method will be called.

For example, the __add__ method is a magic method which gets called when we add two numbers using the + operator

Eg:

# using + operator without dunder method
num = 10
result = num + 5 # when we use 'num + 5' the + operator calls the __add__(5) method
print(result) # 15

# using dunder method
num = 10
result = num.__add__(5)
print(result) # 15


1.Languages such as Java and C# use the new operator to create a new instance of a class. 
2.In Python the __new__() magic method is implicitly called before the __init__() method. 
3.The __new__() method returns a new object, which is then initialized by __init__().

Eg:
class Cat:

    def __new__(cls): # Overrides method in object
        print('__new__ magic method is called')

    def __init__(self):
        print('__init__ magic method is called')

Cat()

Output:
__new__ magic method is called
