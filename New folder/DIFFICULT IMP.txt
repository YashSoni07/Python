1)why tuple is immutable?
the internal reference of the object cannot be changed 
t=(1,2,[3,4])
here t has an id,2 has id and [3,4] has id
here id of 2 or [3,4] cannot be changed while we can add the data into the list[3,4]
2)why tuple?
	1)less memory,
	2)less weighted (operation used in the tuple should be loaded),
	3)for loop always has to check the data is modified or not
	due to the reasons the tuple is faster and we prefer it than list
((if the tuple has the list then it become unhashable))

3)why dictionary?
list and tuple doesn't tell about the data but has the value. 
Dictionary says about the data also.has unique keys

4)when to use set ?
set:with 2 different data sets. in real time the data will be in lists,tuples,strs
eg:set(l1).unionset(l2)

5)what is list comprehension and lambda function?
List comprehension:
A list comprehension creates a new list by applying an expression or condition to 
each element of the iterable

Lambda function:Lambda function is an anonymous function and is defined by a keyword lambda,
 which cannot be invoked by a function name.
>>If you don’t want to use the code reusability then we can use lambda function. 
Once the cursor goes for the next line then the allocated memory will be vanished 


6)I have a file of 2gb with ram 1gb how to read the data?
Firstly we need to split up the data into chunks . 
As we have the 10gb data we reQuire 10 chunks it will hold the data in the form of the files. 
the files are to be stored in the form of dictionary.
The key in the dictionary holds the address of the file and the value is the data present in the file.
The chunk file is the intermediate file.Once the data is loaded to the intermediate file. 
It stores the data by using the available ram. 
Then from each chunk we should load the data to the output file in the form of the array 
so that the data can be merged up easily


7)how to create public,private and protected function variable and classes
 	_ for protected  variable or function
	__ for private variable or function

8)imp of init file
Init method is a constructor which we call in the oops concept. 
This method is automatically called when an object is created

9)What is the range and xrange?
range is an iterator.iterator is predefined set of data(faster for less data)
xrange is a generator.generator has no data but in runtime it generate the data.xrange is memory efficient(always slow)
((if less data use range else go for xrange)) 

10)
Difference between method and function
Simply, function and method both look similar as they perform in a similar way, 
but the key difference is the concept of ‘Class and its Object‘.
Functions can be called only by its name, as it is defined independently. 
But methods can’t be called by its name only. 
i.e. method is defined within a class and hence they are dependent on that class.
 
11)Diff b/w sortedsort?
A)Sort is method present in the list,sorted is the inbuilt function in python.
when using the sort the list will be sort.

12)
*args and **kwargs allow you to pass multiple arguments or keyword arguments to a function
If the number of keyword arguments is unknown, add a double ** before the parameter name:


13)What is difference between authentication and authorisation?
Authentication is nothing but the login in other words its the process of verifying the data
                               OR
User credentials like userid and password
  
Authorisation is the level of access provided for the user

14)Difference between null==True and blank==True?
null==True is for backend, which means it create the null column such that 
if no data is provided the database will accept
blank==True is for frontend, which means if the form is provided no data in that field, the form will accept

15)What is generics?
Generic is a programming library for Python that provides tools for generic programming.
there is only one feature – multiple dispatch.

16)Git commands? In proper way?
>>git init
>>git clone url
>>git status
>>git add
>>git commit -m "initial commit"
>>git remote add origin url........................
>>git push -u origin master



Q)write a function that take 2 args eg:5,2 
o/p:11000 (5denotes no of digits, 2 denotes no. of 1’s?)


Q)Custom exceptions?
Q) How can you deploy a project

Q)How to increase the performance of the database
>>allocate more memory
>>optimise queries
>>database version
>>stromger cpu


Q)how the server knows the token has expired
Q) What is a cluster in postgresql or mysql


Q) What is lazy loading and Eager Loading 
A)Eager loading brings all the objects and associated data objects at same times. 
Eager loading uses joins (where possible) to fetch data from the database in as few queries as possible. 
When a separate query is required, like in the case of a HasMany association,
 a single query is emitted to fetch all the associated data for the current set of objects.

Lazy loading loads the first level data object. 
But when the association is called then the required data is fetched.
 While this can save CPU time because possibly unused data is not hydrated into objects,
 it can result in many more queries being emitted to the database.

Q)What is vacuuming in PostgreSQL?
A)Description. VACUUM reclaims storage occupied by dead tuples. 
In normal PostgreSQL operation, tuples that are deleted or obsoleted by an update are not physically removed from their table; they remain present until a VACUUM is done.

Q)How long does Postgres vacuum take?
A)In our production deployments, vacuum operations often take at least 5-10 days. For various reasons, it's not uncommon for them to take 15-20 days, and we've seen some take upwards of 40 days

4)How to create unicode string in python ..what is the use of it ?
Unicode is the map for code points
python 3defaults to Unicode and UTF-8
All strings are Unicode by default and can contain any Unicode character
Most unicode is valid for identifiers.
>>mutliple UTF-8,UTF-16,UTF-32

5)what is csv,how to read csv?
csv is nothing but data in comma separated value Ex:101,charan,2000

#CREATING CSV FILE
import csv
header=['name','area']
data=[
    ['kc','sr'],
    ['jk','Hybd']
    ]
with open("jkl.csv",'w',newline='') as csvfile:
    writer=csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(header)
    writer.writerows(data)

#READING CSV FILE
import csv
with open("jkl.csv",'r') as csv_file:
  reader=csv.reader(csv_file)
  for i in reader:
      print(i)

6)l=[5,10,15,30]
y=sum(l)
print(y)

l=[5,10,15,30]
total=0
for i in range(len(l)):
    total=total+l[i]
print(total)
-------------------------------------------------------
7)Numpy stands for Numerical python,scipy standas for scentific python 
Both numpy and scipy libraries of python,these are used for various operations of the data.

NumPy has a faster processing speed than other python libraries. 
NumPy is generally for performing basic operations like sorting, indexing, and array manipulation. 
The most important feature of NumPy is its compatibility.

SciPy builds on NumPy. All the numerical code resides in SciPy. 
The SciPy module consists of all the NumPy functions.

			"id":1,
			"name": "p1"
		},
{
			"id":2,
			"name": "p2"
		},
		{
			"id":3,
			"name": "p3"
		}
	]
}

l = [i['id'] for i in d['processors']]
print(l)

11)NAMING SYSTEM IN PYTHON:
A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every object in Python. 
An object might be a variable or a method. 
Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python dictionary.

Names:Names are used to identify a object.these are called identifiers.
  Ex:class name ,variable name,function name

>>Name space is a system which controls all the names in system
it allows you to reuse the name in your program.
Ex:
x=4
print(x)  #4
x=5
print(x) #5 rearrange the value
----
x=4
y=5
print(x)#4
print(y) #5
##supose we have 1000 names in ur function we dont have reusing the names so such cases by 
using namespace to reuse the name in ur program.
>>To avoid naming complicts inthe programs.
>>Mainly 3types:1)inbuilt 2)Global 2)Local scope

>>Django is an open-source framework for backend web applications based on Python — 
one of the top web development languages. Its main goals are simplicity, flexibility, reliability, and scalability. 
Django has its own naming system for all functions and components (e.g., HTTP responses are called “views”).

12)RANGE(),XRANGE()
       range()                           xrange()
>>here both are in built functions in python used to genarate list of integers with in the range.
>>it returns a list object                  >>it returns a genarator object
>>it consumes more memory compared          >>less
to xrange
>>adition,slicing operations can be         >>No such operations are performed because it returns 
perfomed,because range returns list          genarator object
of integers.
>>Not using yield keyword                  >>here using yield keyword
>>slower than xrange                       >>faster than range

Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all
duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

Input: hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again

Then, the output should be:

Output: again and hello makes perfect practice world'''
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
s="hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again"
y=s.split()
print(y)
k=list(set(y))
k.sort()
print(" ".join(k))  #again and hello makes perfect practice world
##############################################################################################
# The challenge is to find all the pairs of two integers in an unsorted array that sum up to a given S.
Write a function to take an array of numbers and sum as inputs.
# It should return an array of integer pairs adding up to the sum.

# Example: if the array is [10, 5, 2, -4, 8, 11] and the sum is 7, your program should return an array of pairs summing to 7, i.e,
# [ [11, -4], [2, 5] ]
# because 11 + -4 = 7 and 2 + 5 = 7.

#write on fib series
from itertools import combinations
array=[10, 5, 2, -4, 8, 11]
s=7
comb=combinations(array,2)
d=[]
for i in comb:
    if sum(i)==7:
