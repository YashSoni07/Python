Prime Numbers:
=============
A positive natural number greater than 1, which only divisible by itself and 1 is known as a prime number. 

For example, 23 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself 
whereas 24 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 1,2,3,4,6,8,12 and itself.

Eg1:

# taking input from user
number = int(input("Enter any number: "))

# prime number is always greater than 1
if number > 1:
    for i in range(2, number):
        if (number % i) == 0:
            print(number, "is not a prime number")
            break
    else:
        print(number, "is a prime number")

# if the entered number is less than or equal to 1
# then it is not prime number
else:
    print(number, "is not a prime number")
